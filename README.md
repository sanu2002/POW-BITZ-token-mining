# 💥 POW-BITZ Token Mining on Eclipse

## Beginner's Guide to Collecting $BITZ on Eclipse

### 🪙 What is Bitz?
> Collect **$BITZ** by breaking PoW (Proof-of-Work) blocks on the **Eclipse** network.

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- ✅ **Eclipse Wallet**: Make sure your wallet is set up and funded with ETH on Eclipse.
- 💻 **Terminal Access**: You’ll need a computer with terminal (command line) access.

---

## 🛠️ Install Dependencies

### 🔧 Install Rust

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### 🔧 Install Solana CLI

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://solana-install.solana.workers.dev | bash
```

> ⚠️ **Postfix Error Fix** (if encountered during Solana installation):

```bash
sudo apt purge postfix -y
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

---

## 🔑 Setting Up Your Wallet

### ✅ Use an Existing Wallet

```bash
solana-keygen recover
```

> Enter your **seed phrase** when prompted.

### 🆕 Generate a New Wallet

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

> Default path: `~/.config/solana/id.json`  
> Custom path:

```bash
solana-keygen new -o /path/to/keypair.json
```

### 🔄 Convert Base58 Key to JSON

If you have a private key in Base58 format and want to generate a `keypair.json` file:

```python
import base58
import json

# Replace with your Base58-encoded key
base58_key = "yourprivatekey"

# Decode the Base58 key into bytes
decoded = base58.b58decode(base58_key)

# Convert bytes to list of integers
key_array = list(decoded)

# Save as a JSON file
with open("keypair.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(key_array, f)

print("✅ keypair.json created!")
```

> 💡 Make sure you're running this Python script in the correct directory where you want your key file saved.

## ⚙️ Configure Solana CLI for Eclipse

```bash
solana config set --url https://bitz-000.eclipserpc.xyz/
```

---

## 📦 Install Bitz Miner CLI

```bash
cargo install bitz
```

---

## 🔁 Bitz CLI Usage

### ➕ Collect $BITZ
```bash
bitz collect
