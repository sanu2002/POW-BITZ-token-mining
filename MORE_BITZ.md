HOW TO MAXIMIZE $BITZ MINING REWARDS !

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


🚀 1. Understanding the Mining Logic
The $BITZ token uses ePOW (Eclipse Proof-of-Work) which is currently CPU-based, not GPU-optimized like traditional Ethereum mining used to be. The bitz collect command leverages CPU cores—not GPU threads.

So:

📌 Using more CPU cores increases your chances of getting mining rewards.

⚠️ 2. If You Can't Increase CPU Cores (Locally)
Here are practical alternatives to boost rewards:

✅ A. Use External or Multiple Machines (Horizontal Scaling)
Rent multiple VPS (e.g., from Hetzner, Contabo, or AWS EC2).

Set up mining on each with your wallet address.

Each one adds more total hash power under your address.

✅ B. Consider High-Core VPS / Dedicated Servers
Get a server with 16+ cores.

Even mid-tier VPS with 6–8 cores can outperform most desktops.

✅ C. Use an eGPU? Not Useful Yet
Currently, GPU support is not available or optimized for $BITZ mining.

The client only uses CPU (--cores param), so even an external GPU (eGPU) won’t help unless future versions add GPU support.

🧠 3. Smart Optimization Tips
Don't max out cores: Always leave 1–2 for system tasks. If you overload, it can throttle and reduce effective mining.

Monitor system temps & throttling: If cores overheat, it slows down work.

Use screen or tmux to keep mining running in the background on VPS.

Automate mining restarts on failure with a script or cronjob.

🌐 4. Recommended Setup Example
Let’s say you have:

A local machine with 4 cores → Use --cores 2 or 3

2 VPS with 8 cores → Use --cores 6 on each

This setup spreads your load and increases total work submitted to the network under your wallet address.
